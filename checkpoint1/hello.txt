Hello everybody!

My name is Ben Collins and I'm currently a freshmen at the School of Engineering with no idea 
what I'm going to major in (but DS sounds like a lot of fun so that's why I'm here). My fun fact
is that my dog's name is Brad. This typically confuses people when I call him over or talk about
him so consider this the heads up just to mitigate the confusion.
